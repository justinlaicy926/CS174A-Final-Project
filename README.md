## Description
We are implementing a first-person shooter game from the perspective of the famous peashooter from Plants vs Zombies. Set in a beautiful garden, the loyal peashooter defends its ownerâ€™s home and takes on waves of zombies with the green pea bullet shot from its mouth.

## Features

We have implemented interactive graphics in our peashooter game. Picking the mouse (an advanced feature) triggers a pea shot in the direction of the mouse click. We have also implemented a skybox and a beautiful lawn texture, mirroring those from the original videogame. We have planted a variety of zombies in the view of the peashooter.
